# Guitar Chord App

###### Description

This is my project two React app that uses an API call to display information. This app teaches the user how to play different guitar chords. I casually enjoy playing guitar, so I was inspired to build this app.

###### Technologies Used

This app was built using React. I did not use a CSS framework.

###### Getting Started/Installation Instructions

Guitar Chord App is run in the browser. Just simply click the link and get started. Once in the app, you can simply press or click the button for the chord you would like to see and it will display. Use the navbar at the top to navigate. There is an about page with some useful information, as well as, a video component that plays a great tutorial on how to play many of the chords listed in the app. The app is deployed on Heroku.
